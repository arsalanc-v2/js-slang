Source \S 3 Non-Det is a nondeterministic variant of Source \S 3.

\section*{Changes}

Source \S 3 Non-Det modifies Source \S 3 by adding an automatic search mechanism into the language semantics. The language allows programmers to specify \emph{choices} and \emph{requirements}. At runtime, the search mechanism automatically resolves these requirements, and identifies all those choices that satisfy them. \newline

This is achieved by supporting a new type of expression, called the \emph{choice point} expression. Every choice point expression is described by a (possibly empty) set of \emph{expressions} (known as the set of \emph{choices}). At runtime, a choice point expression can assume any value from its set of choices. A program can also include instructions that force the language processor to \emph{backtrack} to any choice point expression. \emph{Backtracking} means that the choice point expression will take on a different value from its set of choices, and the program will then be re-evaluated with this new choice. \newline

A Source \S 3 Non-Det program can contain any number of choice points. Evaluating a program can hence have an exponential number of outcomes - one outcome for every combination of possible choices. The language's search mechanism, however, only returns one outcome at a time. The programmer can \emph{command} the search mechanism to re-evaluate the program with a different combination of choices. On the Source Academy platform, this command is implemented as the keyword
\textbf{\texttt{try again}}, which has to be entered into the programming REPL.
